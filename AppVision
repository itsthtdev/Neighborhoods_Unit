PROJECT: Eugene Neighborhood Associations Collaboration Platform
Overview:
Build a web application for approximately 10 neighborhood associations in Eugene to manage their internal operations and collaborate with each other.
Core Features:
	1.	Multi-Association Management
	∙	Each neighborhood association operates as a separate entity within the platform
	∙	Associations can sign up and create their own accounts
	∙	Support for smooth leadership transitions (when presidents/officers change)
	1.	Role-Based User Management
	∙	President/Chair
	∙	Vice President
	∙	Treasurer
	∙	Area Representatives
	∙	General Members
	∙	Access and permissions should align with these roles
	1.	Document Management
	∙	Store and organize association documents
	∙	Version control and document history
	∙	Easy access for current leadership and appropriate members
	1.	Issue & Topic Tracking
	∙	Track what neighbors are saying/reporting
	∙	Manage topics that need attention
	∙	Track items that need to be communicated to the city
	∙	Action item management
	1.	Inter-Association Collaboration
	∙	Open portal/messaging system where associations can communicate with each other
	∙	Ability to collaborate on shared initiatives
	∙	Discussion forums or channels for cross-association coordination
	1.	Integration Requirements
	∙	Google Workspace: Most associations already use Google Workspace
	∙	Google authentication (OAuth)
	∙	Potential Google Drive integration for document storage
	∙	Google Calendar integration
	∙	Email Platform Integration: Associations use various platforms
	∙	MailChimp (confirmed)
	∙	Other platforms (to be determined)
	∙	Need ability to integrate with their existing email/communication tools
	∙	Eugene Neighborhood Inc: Central organization that holds funds for the associations
	∙	Need some form of connection/integration for fund management
	1.	Account Succession
	∙	When leadership changes (new president elected, etc.), new officers should inherit access to all association resources
	∙	Historical documents and data should transfer seamlessly
	∙	No loss of institutional knowledge during transitions
Technical Considerations:
	∙	Web-based platform
	∙	User-friendly interface for non-technical community volunteers
	∙	Secure authentication and data privacy (separate association data)
	∙	Scalable to accommodate future growth beyond 10 associations
